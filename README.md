Verification of Machine Learning Based Image Classifiers through Metamorphic Testing

This repository captures the data, code and results from the usage of Metamorphic Testing for ML based image classifiers. We have worked with an SVM based image classifier and a deep learning based image classifier (ResNet).

Contents:
	ML Applications: Holds the code, mutants, and results.
	Appendix: Plots of the results, commentary on the Mutants that were caught and those that weren't, discussion on the experimental set-up.
